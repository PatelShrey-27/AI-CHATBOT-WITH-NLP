Task 3: AI Chatbot Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
For the third task of my internship, I was assigned to develop an AI-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) principles. The objective was to create an interactive, user-friendly chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user queries, mimicking human conversation to a basic degree. I implemented the chatbot using web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — supported by simple rule-based NLP logic.

Project Setup and Interface Design
The chatbot interface was built using HTML and styled with CSS to provide a clean and responsive design. The UI consists of a chat window where users can type their questions and receive replies. A text input field and a send button were integrated to simulate real-time conversations, mimicking a messaging application.

The visual appeal was enhanced through CSS styling, which ensured the chatbot window is scrollable, readable, and aesthetically pleasing. While the main goal was to focus on functionality, I ensured the user experience remained intuitive and easy to navigate.

Functionality and Logic
The chatbot’s core logic was developed using JavaScript. Rather than using a complex machine learning model, I implemented a rule-based system where user inputs are matched against predefined patterns or keywords. Based on the input, the chatbot generates appropriate responses.

For instance, if a user types “hello,” “hi,” or “hey,” the chatbot recognizes this as a greeting and replies with a warm response. If a user asks for the time, date, or help, the chatbot provides relevant answers by using JavaScript’s Date object or simple logic to retrieve that data. For unmatched queries, it returns a default message like “I’m still learning to answer that. Try asking something else.”

This method of NLP is simplistic but effective for foundational chatbot development. It demonstrates how conditional logic, string matching, and keyword identification can be used to simulate natural language understanding.

Learning Outcomes
Creating this chatbot helped me understand the basic workflow of how conversational AI tools are structured. I learned to:

-> Design a web-based chat interface using HTML/CSS

-> Capture and process user input in JavaScript

-> Apply conditional logic to simulate natural language responses

-> Enhance user interactivity using event listeners

-> Handle unexpected inputs gracefully with fallback messages
